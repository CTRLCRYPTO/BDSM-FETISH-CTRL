<p><strong>The Algorithm X11</strong></p>
<p>it is in this context that appeared the Algorithm X11 at the end of 2014. This algorithm which has been designed for crypto-currencies, is still more secure than the algorithm SHA-256 and presents the advantage of not being able to be used by &#8220;Application Specific Integrated Circuits&#8221;. It is currently being used in several crypto-currencies, the most famous being DASHCOIN.</p>
<p>X11 organizes a chain of 11 different hash algorithms: Blake, BMW, groestl, JH, keccak, skein, Luffa, cubehash, shavite, SIMD, and echo. To fail, the whole 11 hashing algorithms must default simultaneously. It is estimated that the probability of such a situation is close to zero.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as we have seen above, the ASICs can only be programed for one function, i.e SHA-256. Yet an ASIC will cannot be programed to proceed with the hash of two (or more) different algorithms simultaneously. This is the reason why ASICs cannot be used to perform the Algorithm X11 since it included 11 different algorithms.</p>
